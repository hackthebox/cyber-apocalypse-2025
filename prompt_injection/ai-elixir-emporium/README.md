# [ Elixir Emporium ](#)

### Description:
* There once was a renowned hidden potion emporium in Eldoria that fell into the hands of the followers of Malakar, who took all the potions and left the shop empty. Nobody knew who had created those powerful potions. The reclusive wizard who owned the shop had bound it to a spirit that sold the potions. The fellowship must find the wizard to prepare counter-potions before reaching the Obsidian Citadel. They engage the shop's spirit to learn about the wizard, but the spirit is bound by a tongue-censor spell that censors any information related to the wizard. Can you help with your prompt injection skills to bypass the censorship and discover the name of this elusive wizard? Flag format: `HTB{Name Of The Wizard}`.
